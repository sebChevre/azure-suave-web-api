<body>
This sample application is an in-memory capabilities-based data store. It is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete">CRUD</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">RESTful</a> web API built using <a href="http://suave.io">Suave</a>.

<h2>API description</h2>

<ul>
<li><code>PUT /api/create</code>. The body of the request is placed in the data store, and the API returns a GUID that can be used to read, update, delete, or delegate access to the data.
<li><code>GET /api/read{guid}</code>. If the supplied GUID has read access to some data, that data is returned.
<li><code>GET /delegate/{access}/{guid}</code>. Access must be a string that contains some combination of <code>r</code> (read), <code>u</code> (update), and <code>d</code> (delete). If the access requested is the same or a subset of the access on the supplied GUID, a new GUID is returned that has the requested access rights on the supplied GUID.
<li><code>POST /api/update/{guid}</code>. If the supplied GUID has update access to some data, that data is changed to be the body of the request.
<li><code>DELETE /api/delete/{guid}</code>. The GUID supplied is deleted. If the supplied GUID has delete access to some data, the entire chain of GUIDs back to the source is deleted.
</ul>
</body>
